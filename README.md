# Pharmacy-Records
A program that lets you add, search, delete and update pharmaceutical records (in progress)

This project mainly uses scala, HTML and JavaScript. A database is made using scala, which stores the necessary data

The add part of the project lets us add the necessary details of a newly added drug into oour system
The search part, searches with ID and tells you the availability status of the drug
The delete part let's us delete those drugs that have expired or are empty
The update part is an automatic updation system that updates everytime someone buys the drug

Currently, the databse, addition, and the HTML part of this is done.

Things that need working:
1. Search should display
2. Delete and Update
3. Web socket corrections
4. CSS designing part
